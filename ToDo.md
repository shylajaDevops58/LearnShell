 So, how to authenticate to our GitHub account from our computer ?
 1) On your GitHub account, generate a PAT ( Personal Access Token )
 2) Now save that on a notePad, on your VSCode, run the "git push" couple of times and you'd see the prompt to enter the token
 3) That's it and it's an one time effort and from now you can publish the code to your repo n number of times.
